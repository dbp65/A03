GIT - Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

GITHUB - GitHub is a US-based global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.

Repository - A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history.

Clone - git clone. The "clone" command downloads an existing Git repository to your local computer.

Commit - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).

Push - Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.

Pull - Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

Branch - The way git, and GitHub, manage this timeline — especially when more than one person is working in the project and making changes — is by using branches.

Merge - Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.

Merge Conflict - Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

Fetch - The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.

Remote - A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.
